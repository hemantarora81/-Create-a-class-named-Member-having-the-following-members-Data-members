//        Data members
//        1 - Name
//        2 - Age
//        3 - Phone number
//        4 - Address
//        5 - Salary
//        It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
//        Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively.
//         Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an employee
//         and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same.
